      "Nepal\n",
      "Nepal\n",
      "The  Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal  is a country north of  India  best known for its Himalayas mountains. Nepal has at least partial control of eight of the world's ten tallest peaks, including Mt. Everest, Kanchenjunga, and Lhotse.  [2]   Most of Nepal's population is  Hindu , but there are significant minorities of  Buddhists  and  Muslims . Nepal's religious traditions go back a long way, and there are a variety of notable temples scattered across the country that attract tourism.  [3]   The country's capital and largest city is Kathmandu.\n",
      "But Nepal isn't all backpackers and monasteries. Nepal recently transitioned into a  republic  in 2008 after the abolition of the  monarchy , and it still struggles with political disputes between Maoists and  conservatives . Nepal's economy suffers from widespread poverty and other significant problems like poor infrastructure, a major obstacle to industrialization. Most of the people are employed in the agricultural sector. Unfortunately, human trafficking, sex  slavery , and  child   prostitution  are also commonplace. Some girls are abducted by slaving gangs or tricked by promises of paid jobs, while others are sold into slavery by their poverty-stricken families. Many are sold across the border by human traffickers, ending up in red light districts of Indian cities.\n",
      "Nepal has an ancient history. In the middle of the 1 millennium BCE, Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, was born in Lumbini in southern Nepal. Over these early centuries, Nepal was influenced by  Tibetan  culture from the north and Indo-Aryan culture from closer to home. Nepal became a hub for trade along the Silk Road, turning it into a diverse and cosmopolitan area in the old world. In 1768, the Gorkha Kingdom, ruled by the Shah dynasty (no relation to  Iran ), unified Nepal by conquest. It entered a close relationship with the  British Empire , which used it as a buffer state between British India and  Imperial China . However, the Shahs had a rival family called the Rana dynasty, and the  Romeo and Juliet  conflict between them threw Nepal into turmoil and caused much bloodshed.\n",
      "By 1991, things had come to a head with the Shah kings trapped between their Rana rivals and growing popular discontent and support for Maoist  communism . Nepal blew up into  civil war  in 1996, which lasted ten years and eventually led to Nepal's reestablishment as a  secular  republic in 2008 with representation for the Maoists. Nepal still struggles with the legacy of that war and the damage it caused.\n",
      "Contents\n",
      "Historical overview\n",
      "Early history\n",
      "People have lived in Nepal since at least the Stone Age, although their cultures are too unknown for us to say much about. Things started to heat up around 2000 BCE when northern India came under the rule of a group called the Arya, or the  Aryans . The Indo-Aryans formed many little kingdoms that then constantly battled and formed alliances for protection. Despite all of that violence, the Silk Road trade route brought goods and  gold  from nearby China, allowing many of the kingdoms in the region to develop cities and urban living.  [4]\n",
      "Rise of Buddhism\n",
      "One of these warring states in southern Nepal was ruled by the Shakya clan, and sometime around the 5th to 4th century BCE, the clan produced its most famous member: Siddhārtha Gautama.  [5]   Gautama would become known as  Buddha  after abandoning his aristocratic lifestyle in favor of asceticism and teaching spirituality. He was the founder of the Buddhist  religion , which remains influential in Nepal today.\n",
      "Warfare in northern India eventually produced the Mauryan Empire in 322 BCE, whose rulers had adopted a remarkably aggressive policy of  imperialism  to conquer almost the entire Indian subcontinent.  [6]   At its height, the empire was inherited by Ashoka Maurya, or Ashoka the Great, who started off as a great warmonger before unexpectedly and suddenly converting to Buddhism and renouncing war and conquest.  [7]   Ashoka's conversion greatly magnified the influence of Buddhism, and Ashoka commissioned a bunch of monuments across Nepal to commemorate Buddha and his message.  [8]\n",
      "Even after the downfall of the Mauryans and the resumption of warfare in northern India, Nepal was known as a refuge where Buddhist ways and writings could be preserved.  [9]   It also served as a base from which Buddhist teachings entered  Tibet  and spread from there.\n",
      "Disunity and warfare\n",
      "Nepal remained disunited throughout ancient times and the  Middle Ages , likely due to its mountainous landscape making conquest and consolidation difficult. Medieval times brought about seismic changes to Nepal's religious landscape because let's face it, even eastern religions didn't always get along.  Hinduism , which had controlled most of India before Buddhism threatened its power, struck back with a vengeance, and the era where Nepal served as a Buddhist home base ended abruptly.  [10]   Buddhists also started fighting amongst themselves (it wasn't all zen and meditating) over the increasing class divides between elaborate monasteries and everyday monks.  [10]   Monasteries became more rich and powerful, evolving to the point where they often became small towns.\n",
      "This collapse into infighting came at just the wrong time. Muslim Turks conquered their way into northern India, establishing the Delhi Sultanate in 1206 and moving on to conquer most of the subcontinent.  [11]   The various Nepalese kingdoms militarized rapidly for their own survival, but many of them became vassals to Delhi despite never being annexed. This time, the Hindus came to Nepal's rescue by rising against the Delhi Sultanate and bringing about its downfall.  [12]\n",
      "Nepal went back to being split up between various kingdoms, but its culture and traditions still evolved. Nepalese kings usually walked a delicate balance between the two major religions in Nepal, making ostentatious shows of monetary support to both Hindu and Buddhist monasteries and temples.  [13]   By appealing to the peoples' faith, the kings could easily keep them compliant. Nepal's kingdoms remained isolated even as the outside world underwent massive change. Nepal's Buddhist friends to the north, Tibet, were conquered by the decidedly less friendly  Qing dynasty . Meanwhile, most of the rest of India came under the rule of the Muslim-ruled Mughal Empire.\n",
      "Perhaps most important was the growth of British power in India, which occurred as the Mughal Empire began fading away. By 1764 the British East India Company, officially a private trading corporation but fielding its own army, had forced the Mughals to turn over big chunks of northern India at gunpoint. That put them right within striking distance of Nepal.\n",
      "The Gorkhas\n",
      "The Gorkha state, which had begun as a modest holding in the mountains, used its army skills and weapons bought from the British to militarily unify Nepal in 1768 under the rule of Prithvi Narayan Shah.  [14]   The Gorkha state's expansionism brought it into conflict with Tibet over their mountain border, leading them into war with the Qing dynasty.  [15]   Although vastly outnumbered, the Nepalis punched far above their weight class, and they ended the war with a stalemate and a minor diplomatic victory.  [16]\n",
      "This ended Nepal's period of military expansion northward, so they turned southward for new conquests. This brought them into conflict with a power that had proven just a little bit better at imperialism than the Gorkha: the  British Empire . At the war's outbreak in 1814, the Gorkha was again pitted against an enemy they had no business surviving, let alone winning against. But for a second time, Nepal outperformed expectations and kicked ass until the British were forced to redeploy imperial forces to the front and take the war seriously.  [17]   Even in defeat, Nepal maintained its political and diplomatic independence, only being forced to give up on its imperialist ambitions and host a British ambassador.\n",
      "That war left a lasting impression on the British, who had come away with the accurate image that Nepal was filled with crazy badass mountain men. The British called these men the \"Gurkhas\" and were keen to hire Gurkha troops in many of their wars. Beginning with the 1857 uprising against British rule in India, the Gurkhas fought alongside the British and developed strong ties with them.\n",
      "Aristocratic feuds\n",
      "As a country, though, the newly-formed Nepali kingdom started out as more of a distant military dictatorship than a centralized state. To keep people placated, the Shah kings appointed military commanders to act as regional administrators, and they otherwise left people to their own devices.  [18]   Nepal also put great energy into keeping the army happy, mostly by paying them well and handing out agricultural land grants. Emphasis on land grants and the rising power of local landlords rather than the central government meant that Nepal soon evolved into an aristocratic government where different landholder families would duke it out for government influence. Welcome to  feudalism .\n",
      "The Shah kings kept their close friends, the Thapa family, in charge of the government, but the Thapas soon proved insufficiently friendly to British economic interests. The British stepped in during the 1830s to help empower the Kunwar family, who then used a string of assassinations and imprisonments to sweep the Thapas out of power and sweep themselves into it.  [18]   The Kunwars soon proved to be exceptionally ruthless in pursuing power. In 1846, they organized the Kot Massacre in the royal court, killing hundreds of people, wiping out many rival families, and killing off a big chunk of the Shah dynasty itself.  [19]   Goddamn.\n",
      "Rule of the Ranas\n",
      "Family head Jung Bahadur changed the Kunwar family's name to the more prestigious-sounding Rana and then centralized power around himself as prime minister.  [20]   The Shah kings became less than figureheads, requiring written permission from the Ranas to so much as leave their palaces. Jung Bahadur became a close ally of the British, having decided that adopting British ways and British friendship would be the best way to maintain Nepal's political independence.  [21]   Using European legal principles, Jung Bahadur had Nepal's legal codes standardized around the country for the first time ever. He also provided military aid to the British and allowed them to recruit Gurkha troops. As a reward, the British handed Nepal big chunks of territory and made it their official policy to keep the Rana dynasty in charge.\n",
      "After Jang Bahadur's death, the Ranas had to fight off a bunch of assassination and coup plots. They were keenly aware that their family power was legally unfounded, so they became masters at aristocratic knife-fighting and rooting out dissent.  [22]   They also came to rely heavily on goodwill from the military, which soon became the primary means of social mobility in Nepal.\n",
      "During  World War I , the Ranas sent about 200,000 Gurkha warriors to fight for the British. Many of them became feared and decorated soldiers for their brave actions.  [23]   About 20,000 of them died. Gurkhas served throughout the war, most notably on the Western Front,  Iraq , and the Gallipolli Campaign.\n",
      "The British showed their gratitude in 1923, signing a \"Treaty of Perpetual Peace and Friendship\" to confirm Nepal's status as an independent state and valued ally of the British Empire.  [22]   All of this benefited the Ranas, who got to send restless young men to die for the British. Using British conflicts as a pressure valve ensured that troublesome people would have something else to focus on and somewhere else to go.\n",
      "Rising political tensions\n",
      "The Ranas had been strict about preventing political activity, but many Nepali citizens had been exposed to foreign ideas while serving overseas in the Great War. Political parties began forming, such as the pro-democratic Praja Parishad, but the Ranas infiltrated them and had leaders arrested.  [24]   Nepalis were also influenced by the Indian National Congress, which had become an increasingly powerful political force calling for Indian self-determination and an end to British colonial rule.\n",
      "The Ranas once again helped out the British in  World War II , sending 250,280 Gurkha warriors to serve in just about every theatre of the war.  [25]   After the war, though, the Rana family's political position became even more precarious. Close neighbor  China  went up in a full-on  communist  revolution led by  Mao Zedong . At the same time, their British sponsors were pulling out of India. With the Rana family's hold on power loosening, pro-democracy forces put together a new political party: Nepali National Congress. The party was dedicated to ending the Rana dictatorship and establishing  social democracy  to benefit impoverished Nepalis.  [24]\n",
      "Return of the kings\n",
      "In 1950, a ripe time for a change, Nepali King Tribhuvan Shah pretended to go on a hunting expedition before suddenly changing course and seeking asylum in the Indian embassy like a boss.  [20]   In 1951, he came back and teamed up with the Nepali National Congress to force the ouster of the Ranas and establish a constitutional monarchy.\n",
      "Unfortunately, there wasn't to be a happy ending. Tribhuvan died and was succeeded by his son Mahendra. In 1961, Mahendra scrapped any semblance of democracy and declared all political parties illegal, and had their leaders arrested.  [26]   Instead, Nepal would be ruled by administrators personally chosen by the king, in a system he called the  Panchayat , or \"National Guidance.\" With India at war with  Pakistan  and thus preoccupied, the Nepali National Congress had no real international allies.\n",
      "Nepal remained a royal dictatorship for decades without any hope of successful opposition. While the monarchy did modernize Nepal somewhat, it also curtailed civil liberties and imposed heavy  censorship  to ensure its hold on power. Amid growing unrest, King Birendra, who took the throne in 1972, finally agreed in 1991 to institute a parliament and hold elections. However, these reforms were mostly superficial, and the king's power remained largely unchecked.  [27]   Once the people realized that they had been conned, things started to go bad again.\n",
      "Civil war\n",
      "While the monarchy was stomping out dissent, a quiet opposition movement arose in Nepal. Many Nepalese who were unhappy with the monarchy's  authoritarianism  turned to a new direction that they viewed as the best way to overthrow the monarchy: Maoism. Forming in 1994, the Communist Party of Nepal largely managed to slide under the government's notice until it felt that it was ready to launch a full-on assault against the monarchy.  [29]   In 1996, the Maoists began their insurgency in the mountains. At first, the government sent out Nepali police to deal with the crisis, but it soon became clear that cops weren't gonna cut it.\n",
      "The government also banned any anti-monarchy statements and created an effective police state to crush any dissent, no matter how small.  [30]   Rather than seeking total societal transformation, the Maoists only demanded that the government hold elections and end the monarchy. The monarchy, naturally, refused to consider this.\n",
      "While the government maintained tight control of most of Nepal's cities, the Maoists were able to operate with impunity in the rural countryside. Much of that was due to significant rural support for the Maoist rebels, as the Maoists could provide government services to parts of the country that had long been neglected by the monarchy.  [29]\n",
      "Romeo and Juliet destroy the monarchy\n",
      "So, that was the status going into the year 2001. The war was in deadlock, and both sides were unwilling to talk. Luckily for those who wanted peace, but unluckily for the royal family, something huge would get events moving again.\n",
      "In 2001, the heir apparent to the throne was Crown Prince Dipendra \"Dippy\" Shah, who had been educated in the West and had apparently developed a taste for  alcohol . While studying in  England , Dippy fell madly in love with a young hottie named Devyani Rana.  [31]   Notice her last name? Yes, the family that had feuded with and even murdered many of the Shahs now had its prized daughter hook up with the heir of the Shah dynasty. Naturally, the Shah family wasn't down with this since Dippy was banging the old enemy, but he was also supposed to be engaged to a rich heiress with political connections. And, since he wasn't content with even that level of assholery, on top of all that, he was ridiculously abusive towards Devyani.  [31]   King Birendra threatened to disown Dippy's ass and cut him out of the inheritance if he didn't dump poor Devyani. Yeah, Shakespeare has nothing on real life.\n",
      "Long story short, Dippy Shah got (or pretended to get) super drunk one night, gathered up his favorite guns, and busted into the royal palace to go  Scarface  on his whole family.  [32]   Dippy then shot himself and died in a hospital three days later, having briefly been declared king.  [33]   Among those killed included Dippy's father, King Birendra, his mother, Queen Aishwarya, his younger brother Prince Nirajan, his younger sister Princess Shruti, and his aunts and uncles. His otherwise even more apeshit crazy cousin Paras, in one of the only good acts of his life, kept it from being even worse by pulling a couch over himself and three others.\n",
      "End of the war\n",
      "Dippy's uncle Gyanendra then took the throne, and people promptly rioted in the streets due to a popular  conspiracy theory  stating that he had orchestrated the Shah massacre.  [34]   Apart from being a suspected killer, Gyanendra also proved to be exactly the wrong man at the wrong time. While Dipendra had been convinced of the need for a constitutional monarchy and genuine elections, Gyanendra used his power to scuttle peace talks and assume total control over Nepal to crush the Maoists.  [30]   The new king had countless people jailed and  tortured , which thoroughly alienated whatever international support the Nepali monarchy had.  [35]\n",
      "Amid constant protests and escalating violence, Gyanendra finally caved and reinstated Nepal's parliament in 2006, which began the peace process and opened the way for a cease-fire.  [36]   The parliament promptly voted unanimously to strip the king of his authority.  [37]\n",
      "With the Maoists becoming a legal mainstream party and gaining the largest portion of seats in 2008, parliament voted to abolish the monarchy amid much celebration.  [38]\n",
      "Nepal today\n",
      "Nepal is now a federal republic. Promulgated in 2015, Nepal's new constitution completed the country's transition to a republican parliamentary system and theoretically protected basic rights.  [39]\n",
      "Sadly, like most post-war societies, Nepal still struggles with the task of re-establishing political stability. Although the Maoists are now a legitimate political party, they still have a vast weapons stockpile. They often use terrorist tactics to show their power and punish individuals or corporations that fail to comply with the Nepali government.  [40]\n",
      "Nepal's parliament has also been notoriously unstable. Nepal shuffles through governments at roughly one per year, as the legacies of war make political infighting both inevitable and unstoppable.

      "Nepal  (        i      /  n  ə  ˈ  p  ɔː  l  /   ;  [8]    Nepali :  नेपाल    [neˈpal]    (     listen ) ), officially the  Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal ,  [9]   is a  landlocked   country  located in  South Asia . With an area of 147,181 square kilometres (56,827 sq mi) and a population of approximately 27 million,  [2]   Nepal is the world's  93rd largest  country by area  [10]   and the  41st most populous  country. It is located in the  Himalayas  and bordered to the north by  China  and to the south, east, and west by  India . Nepal is separated from  Bangladesh  by the narrow Indian  Siliguri Corridor  and from  Bhutan  by the Indian state of  Sikkim .  Kathmandu  is the nation's  capital city  and largest metropolis.\n",
      "The mountainous north of Nepal has eight of the world's ten  tallest mountains , including the highest point on Earth,  Mount Everest  ( Nepali :  सगरमाथा   Sagarmāthā ). More than 250 peaks over 20,000 ft (6,096 m) above sea level are located in Nepal.  [11]   The southern  Terai  region is fertile and humid.\n",
      "Hinduism  is practiced by about 81.3% of Nepalis, the highest percentage of any country.  Buddhism  is linked historically with Nepal and is practiced by 9% of its people, followed by  Islam  at 4.4%,  Kiratism  3.1%,  Christianity  1.4%,  [2]   and  animism  0.4%.  [12]   A large portion of the population, especially in the hill region, may identify themselves as both Hindu and Buddhist, which can be attributed to the  syncretic  nature of both faiths in Nepal.  [13]\n",
      "A  monarchy  throughout most of its history, Nepal was ruled by the  Shah dynasty  of kings from 1768—when  Prithvi Narayan Shah  unified its many small kingdoms  [1]  —until 2008. A decade-long  Civil War  involving the  Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) , followed by weeks of mass protests by all major political parties, led to the 12-point agreement  [14]   of 22 November 2005. The ensuing elections for the  1st Nepali Constituent Assembly  on 28 May 2008 overwhelmingly favored the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of a  federal   multiparty   representative democratic   republic . Despite continuing political challenges, this framework remained in place, with the  2nd Nepali Constituent Assembly   elected in 2013  in an effort to create a  new constitution .\n",
      "On September 20, 2015, a new constitution  ( Nepali :  नेपालको संविधान २०७२ )  was announced by President  Ram Baran Yadav  in the Constituent Assembly. The Constituent Assembly was transformed into a legislative parliament. The new constitution established Nepal as a federal democratic country by making seven unnamed states.

      "Nepal is a developing country with a low income economy, ranking  145th  of 187 countries on the  Human Development Index  (HDI) in 2014. It continues to struggle with high levels of hunger and poverty. Despite these challenges, Nepal has been making steady progress, with the government making a commitment to graduate the nation from  least developed country  status by 2022.  [19]    [20]\n",

      "Etymology\n",
      "Local legends say that a Hindu sage named \"Ne\" established himself in the valley of Kathmandu in prehistoric times and that the word \"Nepal\" came into existence as the place was protected (\"pala\" in  Pali ) by the sage \"Ne\". It is mentioned in  Vedic  texts that this region was called Nepal centuries ago. According to the   Skanda Purana  , a  rishi  called \"Ne\" or \"Nemuni\" used to live in the  Himalayas .  [21]   In the  Pashupati Purana , he is mentioned as a saint and a protector.  [22]   He is said to have practised  meditation  at the Bagmati and Kesavati rivers  [23]   and to have taught there.  [24]\n",
      "The name of the country is also identical in origin to the name of the  Newar people . The terms \"Nepāl\", \"Newār\", \"Newāl\" and \"Nepār\" are phonetically different forms of the same word, and instances of the various forms appear in texts in different times in history. Nepal is the learned  Sanskrit  form and Newar is the colloquial  Prakrit  form.  [25]   A Sanskrit inscription dated 512 CE found in Tistung, a valley to the west of Kathmandu, contains the phrase \"greetings to the Nepals\" indicating that the term \"Nepal\" was used to refer to both the country and the people.  [26]    [27]\n",
      "It has been suggested that \"Nepal\" may be a  Sanskritization  of \"Newar\", or \"Newar\" may be a later form of \"Nepal\".  [28]   According to another explanation, the words \"Newar\" and \"Newari\" are  vulgarisms  arising from the mutation of P to V, and L to R.  [29]\n",

      "Neolithic  tools found in the  Kathmandu Valley  indicate that people have been living in the Himalayan region for at least eleven thousand years.  [30]   The oldest population layer is believed to be represented by the  Kusunda people .  [31]\n",
      "Nepal is first mentioned in the late Vedic   Atharvaveda Pariśiṣṭa   as a place exporting  blankets  and in the post-Vedic  Atharvashirsha   Upanishad .  [32]   In  Samudragupta 's  Allahabad Pillar  it is mentioned as a bordering country. The   Skanda Purana   has a separate chapter known as \"Nepal Mahatmya\" that explains in more details about the beauty and power of Nepal.  [33]   Nepal is also mentioned in  Hindu  texts such as the  Narayana Puja .  [32]\n",
      "Tibeto-Burman-speaking  people probably lived in Nepal 2500 years ago.  [34]   However, there is no archaeologic evidence of the  Gopal Bansa  or Kirati rulers, only mention by the later  Licchavi  and  Malla  eras.  [35]\n",
      "Around 500 BCE, small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the southern regions of Nepal. From one of these, the  Shakya  polity, arose a prince who later renounced his status to lead an ascetic life, founded  Buddhism , and came to be known as  Gautama Buddha  (traditionally dated 563–483 BCE).\n",
      "By 250 BCE, the southern regions came under the influence of the  Maurya Empire  of  North India  and parts of Nepal later on became a nominal vassal state under the  Gupta Empire  in the fourth century CE. Beginning in the third century CE, the  Licchavi Kingdom  governed the  Kathmandu Valley  and the region surrounding central Nepal.\n",
      "There is a quite detailed description of the kingdom of Nepal in the account of the renowned Chinese Buddhist pilgrim monk  Xuanzang , dating from  c . 645 CE.  [36]    [37]    Stone inscriptions in the Kathmandu Valley  are important sources for the history of Nepal.\n",
      "The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late eighth century, probably due to the  Tibetan Empire , and was followed by a  Newar  or Thakuri era, from 879 CE ( Nepal Sambat  1), although the extent of their control over the present-day country is uncertain.  [38]   In the eleventh century it seems to have included the  Pokhara  area. By the late eleventh century, southern Nepal came under the influence of the  Chalukya dynasty  of  South India . Under the Chalukyas, Nepal's religious establishment changed as the kings patronised  Hinduism  instead of the Buddhism prevailing at that time.\n",

      "In the early 12th century, leaders emerged in far western Nepal whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix  malla  (\"wrestler\"). These kings consolidated their power and ruled over the next 200 years, until the kingdom splintered into two dozen petty states. Another Malla dynasty beginning with  Jayasthiti  emerged in the Kathmandu valley in the late 14th century, and much of central Nepal again came under a unified rule. In 1482 the realm was divided into three kingdoms:  Kathmandu ,  Patan , and  Bhaktapur .\n",

      "<templatestyles src=\"Module:Hatnote/styles.css\"></templatestyles>\n",
      "In the mid-18th century,  Prithvi Narayan Shah , a  Gorkha  king, set out to put together what would become present-day Nepal. He embarked on his mission by securing the neutrality of the bordering mountain kingdoms. After several bloody battles and sieges, notably the  Battle of Kirtipur , he managed to conquer the Kathmandu Valley in 1769. A detailed account of Prithvi Narayan Shah's victory was written by Father Giuseppe, an eyewitness to the war.  [39]\n",
      "The Gorkha dominion reached its height when the North Indian territories of the  Kumaon  and  Garhwal Kingdoms  in the west to  Sikkim  in the east came under Nepal rule. At its maximum extent,  Greater Nepal  extended from the  Teesta River  in the east, to  Kangra, Himachal Pradesh , across the  Sutlej  in the west as well as further south into the Terai plains and north of the Himalayas than at present. A dispute with  Tibet  over the control of mountain passes and inner Tingri valleys of Tibet forced the  Qing Emperor  of  China  to start the  Sino-Nepali War  compelling the Nepali to retreat and pay heavy reparations to Peking.\n",
      "Rivalry between Kingdom of Nepal and the  East India Company  over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the  Anglo-Nepali War  (1815–16). At first the British underestimated the Nepali and were soundly defeated until committing more military resources than they had anticipated needing. They were greatly impressed by the valour and competence of their adversaries. Thus began the reputation of  Gurkhas  as fierce and ruthless soldiers. The war ended in the  Sugauli Treaty , under which Nepal ceded recently captured portions of Sikkim and lands in Terai as well as the right to recruit soldiers.  Madhesis , having supported the East India Company during the war, had their lands gifted to Nepali. [   citation needed   ]\n",
      "Factionalism inside the royal family led to a period of instability. In 1846 a plot was discovered revealing that the reigning queen had planned to overthrow Jung Bahadur Kunwar, a fast-rising military leader. This led to the  Kot massacre ; armed clashes between military personnel and administrators loyal to the queen led to the execution of several hundred princes and chieftains around the country. Jung Bahadur Kunwar emerged victorious and founded the  Rana dynasty , later known as  Jung Bahadur Rana .\n",
      "The king was made a titular figure, and the post of Prime Minister was made powerful and hereditary. The Ranas were staunchly pro-British and assisted them during the  Indian Rebellion of 1857  (and later in both World Wars). Some parts of the Terai region populated with non-Nepali peoples were gifted to Nepal by the British as a friendly gesture because of her military help to sustain British control in India during the rebellion. In 1923, the  United Kingdom  and Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship that superseded the Sugauli Treaty of 1816. [   citation needed   ]\n",
      "Slavery  was abolished in Nepal in 1924.  [40]   Nevertheless, debt bondage even involving debtors' children has been a persistent social problem in the Terai. Rana rule was marked by tyranny,  debauchery , economic exploitation and religious persecution.  [41]    [42]\n",
      "In the late 1940s, newly emerging pro-democracy movements and political parties in Nepal were critical of the Rana autocracy. Meanwhile, with the invasion of Tibet by China in the 1950s, India sought to counterbalance the perceived military threat from its northern neighbour by taking pre-emptive steps to assert more influence in Nepal. India sponsored both  King Tribhuvan  (ruled 1911–55) as Nepal's new ruler in 1951 and a new government, mostly comprising the  Nepali Congress , thus terminating Rana hegemony in the kingdom. [   citation needed   ]\n",
      "After years of power wrangling between the king and the government,  King Mahendra  (ruled 1955–72) scrapped the democratic experiment in 1959, and a \"partyless\"  Panchayat  system was made to govern Nepal until 1989, when the \"Jan Andolan\" (People's Movement) forced  King Birendra  (ruled 1972–2001) to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty parliament that took seat in May 1991.  [43]   In 1991–92,  Bhutan  expelled roughly 100,000 Bhutanese citizens of Nepali descent, most of whom have been living in seven refugee camps in eastern Nepal ever since.  [44]\n",
      "In 1996, the  Communist Party of Nepal  started a bid to replace the royal parliamentary system with a people's republic by violent means. This led to the long  Nepali Civil War  and more than 12,000 deaths.\n",
      "On June 1, 2001, there was a  massacre in the royal palace . King Birendra, Queen  Aishwarya  and seven other members of the royal family were killed. The perpetrator was  Crown Prince Dipendra , who committed suicide (he died three days later) shortly thereafter. This outburst was alleged to have been Dipendra's response to his parents' refusal to accept his choice of wife. Nevertheless, there is speculation and doubts among Nepali citizens about who was responsible. [   citation needed   ]\n",
      "Following the carnage, King Birendra's brother  Gyanendra  inherited the throne. On February 1, 2005, King Gyanendra dismissed the entire government and assumed full executive powers to quash the violent Maoist movement,  [43]   but this initiative was unsuccessful because a stalemate had developed in which the Maoists were firmly entrenched in large expanses of countryside but could not yet dislodge the military from numerous towns and the largest cities. In September 2005, the Maoists declared a three-month unilateral ceasefire to negotiate. [   citation needed   ]\n",
      "In response to the  2006 democracy movement , King Gyanendra agreed to relinquish sovereign power to the people. On 24 April 2006 the dissolved House of Representatives was reinstated. Using its newly acquired sovereign authority, on 18 May 2006 the House of Representatives unanimously voted to curtail the power of the king and declared Nepal a  secular state , ending its time-honoured official status as a Hindu Kingdom. On 28 December 2007, a bill was passed in parliament to amend Article 159 of the constitution – replacing \"Provisions regarding the King\" by \"Provisions of the Head of the State\" – declaring Nepal a  federal republic , and thereby abolishing the monarchy.  [45]   The bill came into force on 28 May 2008.  [46]\n",

Although acts of violence occurred during the pre-electoral period, election observers noted that the elections themselves were markedly peaceful and \"well-carried out\".  [47]\n",
      "The newly elected Assembly met in Kathmandu on May 28, 2008, and, after a polling of 564 constituent Assembly members, 560 voted to form a new government,  [46]   with the monarchist  Rastriya Prajatantra Party , which had four members in the assembly, registering a dissenting note. At that point, it was declared that Nepal had become a secular and inclusive democratic republic,  [48]    [49]   with the government announcing a three-day public holiday from May 28–30. [   citation needed   ]  The king was thereafter given 15 days to vacate  Narayanhity Palace  so it could reopen as a public museum.  [50]\n",
      "Nonetheless, political tensions and consequent power-sharing battles have continued in Nepal. In May 2009, the Maoist-led government was toppled and another coalition government with all major political parties barring the Maoists was formed.  [51]    Madhav Kumar Nepal  of the  Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist)  was made the Prime Minister of the coalition government.  [52]   In February 2011 the Madhav Kumar Nepal Government was toppled and  Jhala Nath Khanal  of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) was made the Prime Minister.

      "The political parties were unable to draft a constitution in the stipulated time.  [55]   This led to dissolution of the Constituent Assembly to pave way for new elections to strive for a new political mandate. In opposition to the theory of  separation of powers , then Chief Justice Khila Raj Regmi was made the chairman of the  caretaker government . Under Regmi, the nation saw peaceful elections for the constituent assembly. The major forces in the earlier constituent assembly (namely CPN Maoists and Madhesi parties) dropped to distant 3rd and even below.  [56]    [57]\n",

See  List of territories by size  for the comparative size of Nepal. It lies between latitudes  26°  and  31°N , and longitudes  80°  and  89°E .\n",

      "The southern lowland plains or  Terai  bordering India are part of the northern rim of the  Indo-Gangetic Plain . They were formed and are fed by three major Himalayan rivers: the  Kosi , the  Narayani , and the  Karnali  as well as smaller rivers rising below the permanent snowline. This region has a subtropical to tropical climate. The outermost range of foothills called  Sivalik Hills  or Churia Range cresting at 700 to 1,000 metres (2,297 to 3,281 ft) marks the limit of the Gangetic Plain, however broad, low valleys called  Inner Tarai Valleys  (Bhitri Tarai Uptyaka) lie north of these foothills in several places.\n",
      "The Hill Region ( Pahad ) abuts the mountains and varies from 800 to 4,000 metres (2,625 to 13,123 ft) in altitude with progression from subtropical climates below 1,200 metres (3,937 ft) to alpine climates above 3,600 metres (11,811 ft). The  Lower Himalayan Range  reaching 1,500 to 3,000 metres (4,921 to 9,843 ft) is the southern limit of this region, with subtropical river valleys and \"hills\" alternating to the north of this range. Population density is high in valleys but notably less above 2,000 metres (6,562 ft) and very low above 2,500 metres (8,202 ft) where snow occasionally falls in winter.\n",
      "The Mountain Region ( Himal ), situated in the Great Himalayan Range, makes up the northern part of Nepal. It contains the highest elevations in the world including 8,848 metres (29,029 ft) height  Mount Everest  ( Sagarmāthā  in Nepali) on the border with China.

[68]   This is approximately twice the speed at which human fingernails grow, which is very fast given the size of the blocks of Earth's crust involved. [   original research?   ]  As the strong Indian continental crust subducts beneath the relatively weak Tibetan crust, it pushes up the Himalayan Mountains.

      "Nepal has seen rapid political changes during the last two decades. Up until 1990, Nepal was a monarchy under executive control of the King. Faced with a communist movement against absolute monarchy,  King Birendra , in 1990, agreed to a large-scale political reform by creating a  parliamentary monarchy  with the king as the  head of state  and a prime minister as the head of the government.\n",
      "Nepal's legislature was  bicameral , consisting of a  House of Representatives  called the Pratinidhi Sabha and a  National Council  called the Rastriya Sabha. The House of Representatives consisted of 205 members directly elected by the people. The National Council had 60 members: ten nominated by the king, 35 elected by the House of Representatives, and the remaining 15 elected by an electoral college made up of chairs of villages and towns. The legislature had a five-year term but was dissolvable by the king before its term could end. All Nepali citizens 18 years and older became eligible to vote.\n",
      "The executive comprised the King and the Council of Ministers (the cabinet). The leader of the coalition or party securing the maximum seats in an election was appointed as the Prime Minister. The Cabinet was appointed by the king on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. Governments in Nepal tended to be highly unstable, falling either through internal collapse or parliamentary dissolution by the monarch, on the recommendation of the prime minister, according to the constitution; no government has survived for more than two years since 1991.\n",
      "The movement in April 2006 brought about a change in the nation's governance: an interim constitution was promulgated, with the King giving up power, and an interim House of Representatives was formed with Maoist members after the new government held peace talks with the Maoist rebels. The number of parliamentary seats was also increased to 330. In April 2007, the  Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)  joined the interim government of Nepal.\n",

The first round of voting, on 19 July 2008, saw  Parmanand Jha  win election as Nepali vice-president, but neither of the contenders for president received the required 298 votes and a second round was held two days later.  Ram Baran Yadav  of the  Nepali Congress  party defeated Maoist-backed  Ram Raja Prasad Singh  with 308 of the 590 votes cast.

On 4 May 2009, Dahal resigned over on-going conflicts with regard to the sacking of the Army chief. Since Dahal's resignation, the country has been in a serious political deadlock with one of the big issues being the proposed integration of the former Maoist combatants, also known as the People's Liberation Army, into the national security forces.  [75]   After Dahal, Jhala Nath Khanal of CPN (UML) was elected the Prime Minister. Khanal was forced to step down as he could not succeed in carrying forward the Peace Process and the constitution writing.

      "According to the 2011 census, Nepal's population grew from 9 million people in 1950 to 26.5 million. From 2001 to 2011, the average family size declined from 5.44 to 4.9. The census also noted some 1.9 million absentee people, over a million more than in 2001; most are male laborers employed overseas, predominantly in South Asia and the Middle East. This correlated with the drop in sex ratio from 94.41 as compared to 99.80 for 2001. The annual population growth rate is 1.35%.  [2]\n",
      "The Nepali are descendants of three major migrations from India,  Tibet , and North  Burma  and the Chinese province of  Yunnan  via  Assam . Among the earliest inhabitants were the  Kirat  of east mid-region,  Newar  of the Kathmandu Valley and aboriginal  Tharu  and  Maithali  in the southern Terai region. The ancestors of the  Brahmin  and  Chetri  caste groups came from India's present  Kumaon ,  Garhwal  and  Kashmir  regions, while other ethnic groups trace their origins to North  Burma  and  Yunnan  and Tibet, e.g., the  Gurung  and  Magar  in the west,  Rai ,  Sunuwar  and  Limbu  in the east (from Yunnan and north Burma via Assam), and  Sherpa  and  Bhutia  in the north (from Tibet).\n",
      "Despite the migration of a significant section of the population to the  Terai  (southern plains) in recent years, the majority of Nepali still live in the central highlands; the northern mountains are sparsely populated. Kathmandu, with a population of over 2.6 million (metropolitan area: 5 million), [   dubious    –  discuss   ]  is the largest city in the country and the cultural and economic heart.\n",
      "According to the  World Refugee Survey 2008 , published by the US Committee for  Refugees  and  Immigrants , Nepal hosted a population of refugees and asylum seekers in 2007 numbering approximately 130,000. Of this population, approximately 109,200 persons were from  Bhutan  and 20,500 from People's Republic of China.  [157]    [158]   The government of Nepal restricted  ethnic Nepali expelled from Bhutan  to seven camps in the  Jhapa  and  Morang  districts, and refugees were not permitted to work in most professions.  [157]   At present, the United States is working towards resettling more than 60,000 of these refugees in the US.  [44]\n",
      "Languages\n",
      "<templatestyles src=\"Module:Hatnote/styles.css\"></templatestyles>\n",
      "Nepal's diverse linguistic heritage stems from four major language groups:  Indo-Aryan ,  Tibeto-Burman ,  Mongolian  and various  indigenous language  isolates. The major languages of Nepal (percent spoken as native language) according to the 2011 census are  Nepali  (44.6%),  Maithili  (11.7%),  Bhojpuri  (6.0%),  Tharu  (5.8%),  Tamang  (5.1%),  Nepal Bhasa  (3.2%),  Bajjika  (3%) and  Magar  (3.0%),  Doteli  (3.0%),  Urdu  (2.6%) and  Sunwar . [   citation needed   ]  In addition, Nepal is home to at least four indigenous  sign languages .\n",
      "Derived from  Sanskrit ,  Nepali  is written in  Devanagari  script. Nepali is the official national language and serves as  lingua franca  among Nepali of different ethnolinguistic groups. The regional languages  Awadhi , Bhojpuri, Maithili and rarely  Urdu  of  Nepali Muslims  are spoken in the southern  Terai Region . Many Nepali in government and business speak English as well.  Varieties of Tibetan  are spoken in and north of the higher Himalaya where standard literary Tibetan is widely understood by those with religious education. Local dialects in the Terai and hills are mostly unwritten with efforts underway to develop systems for writing many in Devanagari or the Roman alphabet.\n",
      "Religion\n",
      "<templatestyles src=\"Module:Hatnote/styles.css\"></templatestyles>\n",
      "The overwhelming majority of the Nepali population follows  Hinduism .  Shiva  is regarded as the guardian deity of the country.  [160]   Nepal is home to the famous Lord Shiva temple, the  Pashupatinath   Temple , where Hindus from all over the world come for pilgrimage. According to Hindu mythology, the goddess  Sita  of the epic  Ramayana , was born in the Mithila Kingdom of King Janaka Raja.\n",
      "Lumbini  is a  Buddhist pilgrimage  site and  UNESCO   World Heritage Site  site in the  Kapilavastu  district. Traditionally it is held to be the birthplace in about 563 B.C. of  Siddhartha Gautama , a Kshatriya caste prince of the Sakya clan, who as the  Buddha Gautama , founded  Buddhism .\n",
      "The holy site of Lumbini is bordered by a large monastic zone, in which only monasteries can be built. All three main branches of Buddhism exist in Nepal and the  Newa people  have their own  branch  of the faith.  [161]   Buddhism is also the dominant religion of the thinly populated northern areas, which are mostly inhabited by Tibetan-related peoples, such as the  Sherpa .\n",
      "The Buddha, born as a  Hindu , is also said to be a descendant of  Vedic   Sage Angirasa  in many Buddhist texts.  [162]   The Buddha's family surname is associated with  Gautama Maharishi .  [163]   Differences between Hindus and Buddhists have been minimal in Nepal due to the cultural and historical intermingling of Hindu and Buddhist beliefs. Moreover, traditionally Buddhism and Hinduism were never two distinct religions in the western sense of the word. In Nepal, the faiths share common temples and worship common deities. Among other natives of Nepal, those more influenced by Hinduism were the  Magar ,  Sunwar ,  Limbu  and  Rai  and the  Gurkhas .  [34]   Hindu influence is less prominent among the  Gurung ,  Bhutia , and  Thakali  groups who employ Buddhist monks for their religious ceremonies.  [34]   Most of the festivals in Nepal are Hindu.  [164]   The Machendrajatra festival, dedicated to Hindu  Shaiva   Siddha , is celebrated by many Buddhists in Nepal as a main festival.  [165]   As it is believed that Ne Muni established Nepal,  [166]   some important priests in Nepal are called \"Tirthaguru Nemuni\".  Islam  is a minority religion in Nepal, with 4.2% of the population being Muslim according to a 2006  Nepali  census.  [167]    Mundhum ,  Christianity  and  Jainism  are other minority faiths.

      "Folklore is an integral part of Nepali society. Traditional stories are rooted in the reality of day-to-day life, tales of love, affection and battles as well as demons and ghosts and thus reflect local lifestyles, cultures and beliefs. Many Nepali folktales are enacted through the medium of dance and music.\n",
      "Most houses in the rural lowlands of Nepal are made up of a tight  bamboo  framework and walls of a mud and cow-dung mix. These dwellings remain cool in summer and retain warmth in winter. Houses in the hills are usually made of unbaked bricks with thatch or tile roofing. At high elevations construction changes to stone masonry and slate may be used on roofs.\n",
      "Nepal's flag  is the only national flag in the world that is not rectangular in shape.  [169]   The constitution of Nepal contains instructions for a geometric construction of the flag.  [170]   According to its official description, the red in the flag stands for victory in war or courage, and is also the colour of the  rhododendron , the national flower of Nepal. Red also stands for aggression. The flag's blue border signifies peace. The curved moon on the flag is a symbol of the peaceful and calm nature of Nepali, while the sun represents the aggressiveness of Nepali warriors.\n",

      "<templatestyles src=\"Module:Hatnote/styles.css\"></templatestyles>\n",
      "The Nepali year begins in mid-April and is divided into 12 months. Saturday is the official weekly holiday. Main annual holidays include the National Day, celebrated on the birthday of the king (28 December), Prithvi Jayanti (11 January), Martyr's Day (18 February), and a mix of Hindu and Buddhist festivals such as  dashain  in autumn, and   tihar   in late autumn. During  Swanti , the Newars perform the  Mha Puja  ceremony to celebrate New Year's Day of the lunar calendar  Nepal Sambat . Most of the festivals in Nepal are Hindu.  [164]\n",
      "Cuisine\n",
      "<templatestyles src=\"Module:Hatnote/styles.css\"></templatestyles>\n",
      "The staple Nepali meal is   Dal bhat  .  Dal  is a lentil soup, and is served over  bhat  (boiled rice), with  tarkari  (curried vegetables) together with  achar  (pickles) or  chutni  (spicy condiment made from fresh ingredients). It consists of non-vegetarian as well as vegetarian items. Mustard oil is a common cooking medium and a host of spices, including cumin, coriander, black pepper, sesame seeds, turmeric, garlic, ginger, methi (fenugreek), bay leaves, cloves, cinnamon, chilies and mustard seeds are used in cooking.  Momo  is a type of steamed dumpling with meat or vegetable fillings, and is a popular fast food in many regions of Nepal.\n",
      "Sports\n",
      "<templatestyles src=\"Module:Hatnote/styles.css\"></templatestyles>\n",
      "Association football  is  the most popular sport in Nepal   [171]   and was first played during the  Rana dynasty  in 1921.  [172]   The one and only international stadium in the country is the  Dasarath Rangasala Stadium  where the  national team  plays its home matches.  [173]\n",
      "Cricket  has  been gaining popularity since the last decade . Since the establishment of the  national team , Nepal has played its home matches on the  Tribhuvan University International Cricket Ground .  [174]   The national team has since won the  2012 ICC World Cricket League Division Four  and the  2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three   [175]   simultaneously hence qualifying for  2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier . They also qualified for the  2014 ICC World Twenty20  in  Bangladesh .  [176]   On 28 June 2014, the  ICC  awarded  T20I  status to Nepal, who took part and performed exceptionally well in the  2014 ICC World Twenty20 .  [177]    [178]   Nepal had already played three  T20I  matches before gaining the status, as  ICC  had earlier announced that all matches at the  2014 ICC World Twenty20  would have  T20I  status.  [179]   Nepal won the  2014 ICC World Cricket League Division Three  held in  Malaysia  and qualified for the  2015 ICC World Cricket League Division Two .  [180]\n",
      "Nepal finished fourth in the  2015 ICC World Cricket League Division Two  in  Namibia   [181]   and qualified for the  2015–17 ICC World Cricket League Championship .  [182]   But Nepal failed to secure promotion to Division One and qualification to  2015–17 ICC Intercontinental Cup  after finishing third in the round-robin stage.  [183]    [184]    Basanta Regmi  became the first bowler to take 100 wickets in the  World Cricket League . He achieved this feat after taking 2 wickets against  Netherlands  in the tournament.
